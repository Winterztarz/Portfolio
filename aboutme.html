I also listen to alot of different music, my music taste is very mixed, what is listen to depends on my mood. And i watch TV-shows and movies, i can't say i have a favorite, since there are so many good shows and movies. But The Vampire Diaries and Game of Thrones is two TV shows i like very much, and Lord of the Rings are some very good movies.

      <p class="hh"> Photoshop, coding (and similar things) </p>
      <p> When i was around 7 years old i enterd this horse based website called "Stallet.se" (the english version is MyDreamStable.com). The site was a place where you could "train and breed horses and be in competitions" but not really. Because what you could do on the site was design your own "stable plan" and a information page, and your own animals. So i tried painting a stable plan in paint, did not go so good, and i got bored. And it went some years before i even logged in again. But 2011 i bought my first tablet, Wacom bamboo fun pen & touch. And with that photoshop elements 8 followed. So i painted alot of painting and stable plans and things like that. And i also designed information pages. Because the information page had a picture/design as background, and then you had to code some text onto the designed picture, and maybe you had more than 1 page, then you had to link to the other pages. So a small bit of coding came in there too. And i also took my digital camera and photographed a lot and edited the pictures in photoshop. Later when i left the site behind. I started blogging about a horse game i played. So that meant editing pictures for the blog. And making headers and things for the blog design. And also playing around and coding my blog so it looked like i wanted it too, so that where i started exploring what html and css was, but never coded something completly on my own, always just editing other peoples codes they put out for free. And that is the story of why and how i started using photoshop, and coding and stuff.

      <p class="hh"> Gaming is fun </p>
      <p>I've most of my life have been using a computer for fun, my dad let me try some games made for kids when i was around 7 years old, and i started exploring the web and found sites to play games on, and i still play alot of games on my computer. It started out with me playing a lot of horse games, and then later a mmorpg called Star Stable Online, trough that game i found friends who showed me other games, like Neverwinter, and CS:GO. Since i knew alot about computers, and a bit about programming, i got intrested in the programming line at optima when visting the school. So i ended up applying for the education, where we would be making websites and games among other things. And one of my dreams had for a while been to design my own awsome game, or get to work at an office for some of the nice big games i played. For example going to stockholm and working on the horse game Star Stable Online, or going to work on Neverwinter, would be a dream come true. And i got in on the education at optima, and trough the friends i got from school i started playing more CS:GO, and some Overwatch and Leauge of Legends, so i can say that my interest for gaming and making my own game has gotten even bigger.

      <p class="hh"> My sport (horseriding)</p>
      <p> Horses, i've been around horses since i was 8 years old, and 9 years later i am still not bored, the opposite acctually, the more you learn and the better you get, the more fun the riding lessions get. I take ridinglessions atleast once a week, and i like beeing around horses and not just riding, taking care of a horse and it's home is also very fun, and it's good training. Horseriding is not just sitting there and "driving", it's an acctual sport, and i can tell you it's much easier to go out and walk for 1h, than to ride 1h. I also have some acctual results in riding, summer 2016 i took the terrain riding mark, an official diploma mark you can get if you do 2 kinds of test on horseback. The test took 2h and after the first 45 minutes my fitness kind of went out, beacuse it took a lot of fitness for that test.  I also have many prizes from "club competitions", showjumping and dressage between 2011 and 2017. The biggest competiion i have got a prize from must be showjumping competitions in Esse, where me and the black horse on the pictures below got trugh a "clear round". It means that if you jump everything in the right order without failning on some of the "rules" you get a prize. </p>
